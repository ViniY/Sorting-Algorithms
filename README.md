# Sorting-Algorithms
The main thing of this project is actually just kind of interest and I am also doing COOMP361 which is highly related to algorithms. So herer I just want to implment
as much sorting algorithm as I can.

I will try latter on transfer all the algorithms into both java and python, but for now I will stay with Python for a while .

I am more than happy if you can help me to check the file if there is anythong incorrect, or you just wanna talk to me.
